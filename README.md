## Variables

#### Some elements you can change/edit depend on your choice
 - `--app-font` - The font. I think the font is so perfect but you can change it anytime, remember the font must either be installed on your pc or imported.
 - `--app-button-...` - the color of min, max, close app buttons.
 - `--accent-hsl` - the color of some elements. Dont change this, change `--accent-hue`, `--accent-saturation`, `--accent-lightness` instead.
 - `--card-radius`, `--card-radius-big` - border radius of most things.
 - ...

*Note*: You can edit a lot of elements. But if you do that, it means my alternative version is not the version you want, so you can use the OG one and edit what you want.
