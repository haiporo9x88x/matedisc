## Variables

#### Some elements you can change/edit depend on your choice
 - `--app-font` - The font. I think the font is so perfect but you can change it anytime, remember the font must either be installed on your pc or imported.
 - `--main-color` - The background. (the main reason I make this)
 - `--popout-color` - The background for some menus and modals.

*Note 1*: Some elements has two values for both `.theme-dark` and `.theme-light`, you can edit both of theme or only one (your current theme color in Appearance setting).
*Note 2*: You can edit a lot of things. But if you do that, it means my alternative version is not the version you want, so you can use the OG one and edit what you want.
> idk why i write this README although no one will read this shit. If someone read this line, i want to ask you that how tf you find this shit lol.
